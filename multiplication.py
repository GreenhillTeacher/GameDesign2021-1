# We are going to print multiplication tables
# Using print statements and a variable
# input ---> variable is container that will hold data and address 
# variables need to have a valid name
base = 2
numberBase = "multiplication"
base3 = 3.5
# print(base + base3)
print(1 * base) # multiplication is represented with *
print(2 * base) # division /
print(3 * base)
print(4 * base)
print(5 * base)
print(6 * base)
print(7 * base)
print(8 * base)
print(9 * base)
print(10 * base)
# when we repeat something we should loop loop with counter
for counter in range(1,11): # initial value that included
    print(counter * base, end="")
